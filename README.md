Diff 2 opened files with ease. Because running `code --diff path1 path2` is too slow.

## Install

Follow the instructions in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-diff), or run the following in the command palette:

```shell
ext install fabiospampinato.vscode-diff
```

## Usage

It adds 1 command to the command palette:

```js
Diff: File // Diff the current file against another one
```

## Demo

## Hints

- **Diff against previous versions**: sometimes diffing against open files is not enough, try [Git File History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-git-history) for diffing against previous versions of the current file.
